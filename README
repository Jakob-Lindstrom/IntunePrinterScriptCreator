This script automatically creates .intunewin files for installing printer thru Intune and Company portal.
Enter the printer name, IP address, color, double-sided print and driver name. If you use LPR, add the LPR queue as well, otherwise keep it empty.

Some manufacturers do not support settings for colour, black and white, or double-sided printing thru PowerShell.

You need to add printer drivers to Intune or the local PCs before using this script.

Right click on Script-Printer-GUI.ps1 and "Run with PowerShell", it will open as administrator.
If IntuneWinAppUtil.exe isn't in the script folder, it will ask if you want it to download it for you.
Add your driver names to DriverNames.json

Files in the folder:
DriverNames.json
readme.txt
Script-Printer-GUI.ps1

First time you run the script it will create a printer folder and ask if you want to download IntuneWinAppUtil.exe. 

Each printer you create while create a subfolder with it's name and the following files.

install-PrinterName.ps1		#Installation script
uninstall-PrinterName.ps1	#Uninstallation script
